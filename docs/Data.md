# Data

Since Kotsu was developed to handle large websites and data is a backbone of well-organized and maintainable product, we've kept an special eye on how Kotsu deals with data.

Built-in data and how it is implemented within templates (and even styles) should provide suffice framework for dealing with all future difficulties of challenging sites.

For cases when it isn't enough, Kotsu has wide side of ways and entry points, at which can be defined additional data.

## Data source

Kotsu implies centralized approach and encourages to store all data within `source/data` directory. Note, that it intended for _data_, not configuration. Though, in some cases configuration can serve as quite legible data (for instance, project paths).

Since large websites usually demands large datasets, it is advisable to place those datasets into standalone reasonably named files within `source/data` directory.

All those datasets should be imported then and defined as part of `index` file, which can be found in `source/data`. This makes `index` a single accumulator of all "public" project data and makes it easier to control which data passed to Kotsu components. Kind-of text database.

To use it, just import it or it's required slice. Kotsu already does it for Nunjucks, by passing all data to Nunjucks, and some of data properties passed to Sass.

Note, that while usually most part of data should be gathered within `source/data`, it might not always serve as full source. For instance, `index` refers to `package.json` to gather some crucial project information, and it also relies on `gruntfile` config values to populate some properties. This implies that sometimes modules are linked to each other and it is okey to feed upon their data.

Besides, some data might come from middleware. For instance, page filepaths or locale information can be obtained only during rendering task, thus it injected during `nunjucks` and `grayMatter` tasks.


## Defining custom data

When predefined data simply doesn't cut, Kotsu provides handy ways to configurate any additional data, which will became available to templates:

1. With Front Matter (Gray Matter) header in the beginning of each page. 

   Any defined with Front Matter content will end up available to current template under `{{ PAGE }}` property. It will also make content of page accessible to other pages with `{{ getPage('/path/to/you/page') }}` Nunjucks function.

   Front Matter data has highest priority and will almost always override any already provided to page defaults or configured properties with mentioned methods below.

2. With `{{ config() }}` function, which allows to set any variables, including page-ones with `{{ config('PAGE.myVar', 'value') }}`

   Defined this way variables isn't available for inter-page accessing via `{{ getPage('/path/to/you/page') }}`, however, it will chain within Nunjucks extends.

   For instance, you can have one layout (base), which extended by another (product) layout, which is, finally, chained by your specific page.

   `{{ config() }}` function is a convenient way to provide defaults for base or product layouts, which will be used in place of any unspecified with Front Matter or `{{ config() }}` data on final page.

3. By specifing page default in `source/data/index.coffee`, `PAGE_DEFAULTS` property.

    Any specified in `PAGE_DEFAULTS` properties will end up as defaults for all pages, which extending `_base.nj` layout, unless pages has assigned specific values to those properties.

4. `nunjucks-task` module injects some variables which can be determined only while running Nunjucks task. For instance, those are all i18n-specific variables, like `PAGE.locale`.
 
   In rare cases it is convenient place to inject your own variables. But do it this way only if they are indeed runtime-dependable.

   Though, not advised, but those properties can be overridden with page Front Matter header whenever needed.

5. Finally, `grayMatter` task hydrates extracted from pages Front Matter data with some additional properties, like `PAGE.url`, which also can be discovered only when running task.
  
## Predefined global variables

Those variables available on all pages

|     property    |                               description                                |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PATH`          | Stores important for templates paths, which were configured in Gruntfile |
| `SITE`          | Stores site-related properties                                           |
| `PAGE`          | Stores page-specific variables                                           |
| `PAGE_DEFAULTS` | Stores defaults for all pages                                            |
| `SOCIAL`        | Stores information about social services used on website                 |
| `ENV`           | Stores environment state                                                 |

### `SITE` properties

Those predefined properties can be changed by either editing `source/data/index.coffee` file, or by redefining them with `{{ config('SITE.myVar', 'value') }}` function.

Note, that most of predefined properties taken from `package.json`, or `gruntfile`.

`[]` marks optional variables, which can leave without assigned value.

### `PAGE` properties

_Remember, that all defined within Front Matter custom properties will be also available under `PAGE` variable._

Note, that a lot of those properties implemented by supplied `_base.nj` and `_main.nj` layouts. If you opt to implement your completely new layout, large portion of properties above, while still will be available, won't work same way as was intended by original Kotsu layouts and you might need to replicate that functionality in your own layouts.

Because of it, usually it is recommended to extend `_base.nj` or `_main.nj` layout, or edit `_main.nj` to your needs.

Non-optional variables (without `[]`) are mandatory to be defined in Front Matter, via `{{ config() }}` or any other allowed within Kotsu method.

|            property            |       type       |                             default value                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                       description                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| `[PAGE.url]`                   | `String`         | Filepath, injected by `grayMatter` task                                | Absolute url to page, without `SITE.homepage`. It is not recommended to override this value, since it used internally to accomplish a lot of dark deeds. Can be overridden to make page think that it's another page.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
